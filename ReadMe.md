# A Twitch Users app

A dynamic list of certain Twitch.tv users using the Twitch API.

This project is one of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges i did for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/learn-how-freecodecamp-works).<br>
You can look through [all my FCC challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/joccaweb).

It's written in JavaScript and jQuery with the use of the [Twitch API](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)). See FCC's [required user stories](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api) for the app.

See my [working app](https://codepen.io/Jocca/pen/PJEjxL) on CodePen.

## Notes

- freeCodeCamp on the Twitch API key: "Due to a change in conditions on API usage explained here Twitch.tv now requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use https://wind-bow.glitch.me/twitch-api instead of twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/kraken ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key."
